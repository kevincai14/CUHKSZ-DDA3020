    "In this question, you will implement two CNN models and train them on the same dataset as Question 3 (Fasion-MNIST). We will discover how well-suited CNNs are for intensive data tasks such as image processing, compared to traditional machine learning algorithms (like those tree tree-based models in Question 3). Similarly, your task is to **run all codes in this script and complete the parts marked with** <font color=Red>\\[TASK\\]</font>.\n",
