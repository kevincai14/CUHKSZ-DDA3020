    "In this question, you will implement two CNN models and train them on the same dataset as Question 3 (Fasion-MNIST). We will discover how well-suited CNNs are for intensive data tasks such as image processing, compared to traditional machine learning algorithms (like those tree tree-based models in Question 3). Similarly, your task is to **run all codes in this script and complete the parts marked with** <font color=Red>\\[TASK\\]</font>.\n",

    "### Introduction of TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is a powerful open-source package for machine learning and deep learning, enabling efficient implementation of complex models like neural networks with ease. First of all, you need to install the TensorFlow package with the version of 2.9\n",
    "\n",

    "by running this commend in your command line window. To check whether the package is successfully installed, you can try to run the following import block. If you're struggling with installing TensorFlow, you can upload the coding assignment to Google Colab for execution or seek assistance from TA."
